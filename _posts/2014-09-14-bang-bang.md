I found another great thing linux provides for the lazy programmers ;)
Most of the time we need to repeat the commands we entered in linux terminal and many hardworking engineers typing it again and again ;)

Famous quote **"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it"** preety much applies here when you use commandline mode to operate your machine or working on remote server via ssh.

Linux provides many tools which remembers history and on top of that we can make our life easy.

Usually i work on servers and whenever try to fire few root access commands and it dont allow  me!! -_-,feels insulting. 
Anyway **sudo !!**  is here to rescue you :)
